#Playbook Report Overview
This documentation is intended to guide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) at Balto through the process of generating a playbook report provided by Balto Data Science (DS). Listed below are the high level steps CSMs should take to obtain a detailed analysis report on any playbook:

1. Create a card in [Data Science Work Requests Asana Board](https://app.asana.com/0/1200386241920646/board) to provide DS with the below information: 
  - The name of the playbook 
  - The start and end dates of the period for which the CSM wishes to obtain analysis for.
2. After all the above necessary information is obtained by DS, DS will generate a report and share it with the CSM within the Asana card created in step 1. The report will be in html format. 

The card should be assigned to Rashmi Kamath. If not available, either Ryan Volkert or Aaron Anderson can be contacted.

Please refer to the remaining sections of this documentation for specifics relevant to the report.
