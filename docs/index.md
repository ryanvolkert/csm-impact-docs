# Overview
This documentation is intended to guide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) at Balto through the process of automated impact or ROI analyses provided by Balto Data Science (DS). Listed below are the high level steps CSMs should take to conduct an analysis with a customer:

1. Create a card in [Data Science Work Requests Asana Board](https://app.asana.com/0/1200386241920646/board) to provide DS with initial information about the client, the KPI, etc.
2. Conduct a meeting with the client to establish how their data tracking the KPI is stored and what data can be shared with Balto for the test.

    - Typically, DS is not needed in this meeting but can attend if necessary.
    - If DS does not attend the meeting, communicate the information you gathered to them in the Asana card created in step 1.
    - DS will communicate via Asana any additional questions or needs on the Balto side for the analysis after ingesting the initial information.<br><br>

3. After all necessary information to conduct the test is obtained by DS, DS will create a shared folder on Google Drive where the CSM will share customer data.
4. DS will set up automatic report generation for your specific analysis (if this is more than a one-time analysis). Requests for report updates can be made Ã  la carte, or you can request reports be sent directly to you at some level of frequency via email or Slack (e.g. daily, weekly). Either type of request should be make in the relevant Asana card.

Please refer to the remaining sections of this documentation for specifics relevant to each step listed above.

An example report can be accessed by clicking on the example listed in the sidebar.
