Listed below are the high level steps CSMs should take to conduct an analysis with a customer: Create a card in Data Science Work Requests Asana Board to provide DS with initial information about the client, the KPI, etc. Conduct a meeting with the client to establish how their data tracking the KPI is stored and what data can be shared with Balto for the analysis. Typically, DS is not needed in this meeting but can attend if necessary. If DS does not attend the meeting, communicate the information you gathered to them in the Asana card created in step 1. DS will communicate via Asana any additional questions or needs on the Balto side for the analysis after ingesting the initial information. After all necessary information to conduct the test is obtained by DS, DS will create a shared folder on Google Drive where the CSM will share customer data. DS will set up automatic report generation for your specific analysis (if this is more than a one-time analysis). Requests for report updates can be made \u00e0 la carte, or you can request reports be sent directly to you at some level of frequency via email or Slack (e.g. daily, weekly). Either type of request should be made in the relevant Asana card. Please refer to the remaining sections of this documentation for specifics relevant to each step listed above. An example report can be accessed by clicking on the example listed in the sidebar.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#overview","text":"This documentation is intended to guide Customer Success Managers (CSMs) at Balto through the process of automated impact or ROI analyses provided by Balto Data Science (DS).

We use call data, desktop events data (such as Checklist & Deck triggers), thumbs feedback data within the time period specified to generate plots which present a high-level visual overview of how the playbook is performing. This gives specific insights like- Checklist usage percentages by agents during the period Displaying win probabilities for individual checklists and top checklist progression sequence in winning calls. Identifying checklists which are potential sticking points in conversations and hard to move past in calls. Deck trigger analysis displaying top performing deck items and also identifying which decks have decklist items thats are rarely used by agents in response to the deck trigger. Thumbs feedback data as provided by agents. What can a CSM do with the report? The goal of the report is to show more detailed analysis on playbook usage and adoption by the agents than what is present in Balto Cloud. CSMs can use the plots to quickly identify pain points in Checklists and Decks and potentially provide feedback to the managers to modify/revise their playbooks to better assist agents. How should the plots in the report be interpreted by the CSMs? Each plot within the report has accompanying text to help the CSMs understand the bars/trends visualized in the plot. If any further explanation or breakdown of the plots are required, a DS team member can be contacted and will be happy to help the CSM. Can a combined report be generated for multiple playbooks for an organization? Unfortunately, No. The way DS currently produces these reports is by extracting data from multiple database tables to link checklist and deck items from the playbook to trigger events in the calls and combining data from two separate playbooks is not possible with our current approach.","title":"Playbook Report FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ_playbook/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"FAQ_playbook/#what-is-dss-specific-methodology-for-conducting-playbook-analyses","text":"We use call data, desktop events data (such as Checklist & Deck triggers), thumbs feedback data within the time period specified to generate plots which present a high-level visual overview of how the playbook is performing.

File names should avoid capitalization, special characters, and spaces when possible. For example, bradley_lead_group_data.xlsx or blg_data.xlsx are acceptable file names, while Bradley Lead Group Data.xlsx is not. If there are security requirements from a specific client that require FTP or something similar, DS will attempt to accommodate those needs. Examples Customers should share data at the agent-time level. Agent-time data are records where each observation represents a single agent-time (e.g. day or week) combination. To use this type of data for an analysis, DS must know who the agent is, whether they make calls using Balto, the time unit of observation, and the KPI value for each agent-time row. Sharing data in this format allows us to line up customer data with what we can pull from our database. Below is an example data sets.

We use statistical modeling, specifically mixed modeling to estimate the marginal impact of Balto usage while simultaneously controlling for as many potential confounding factors as possible. Why use a statistical model instead of comparing group level averages? Statistical ( regression ) models can account for other sources of variation in the KPI of interest besides Balto use. Models can account for time explicitly. Balto use may be correlated with group membership or other factors. Controlling for some of these factors leads to a higher level of confidence that the Balto effect is really due to Balto and not some other source of variation. Regression models avoid unnecessary aggregations. As a general rule, statistical analyses should rely on as much relevant information as possible. Computing group-level or time-level statistics removes information about variation in performance across agents or time periods. Regression models can measure the magnitude of the Balto effect, formally test whether it is statistically different from zero, and compute condfidence intervals to address uncertainty. How much data do I need? As a general rule of thumb, more data is always better. When conducting an ROI or any analysis, sample size can be thought of as a 'net' to catch statistically significant effects. The larger the sample size, the smaller the holes in the net are. On the converse, when sample size is small the holes in the net are large. The implication of this is that a larger sample size is better because it enables us to catch a smaller effect. If sample size is not large enough, the holes in the metaphorical net may be too large to observe the occurrence of a small but significant effect. What is typically reported in the summary table? Estimated Balto effect : This is what is commonly referred to as 'lift' at Balto, and represents a percentage deviation from the average of the KPI being tested. P-value : Determines whether the estimated Balto effect is 'statistically significant'. The general rule of thumb is the lower the p-value, the better. DS considers any p-value lower than 0.15 to be a statistically significant result. 95% CI lower/upper bound : The lower and upper bounds of a 95% confidence interval around the estimated Balto effect. The simplest way to interpret these two numbers are that they represent an upper and lower threshold in which DS has a given level of statistical certainty (specifically, 95% certainty) that the true Balto effect falls within.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-dss-specific-methodology-for-conducting-analyses","text":"We use statistical modeling, specifically mixed modeling to estimate the marginal impact of Balto usage while simultaneously controlling for as many potential confounding factors as possible.","title":"What is DS's specific methodology for conducting analyses?"},{"location":"faq/#why-use-a-statistical-model-instead-of-comparing-group-level-averages","text":"Statistical ( regression ) models can account for other sources of variation in the KPI of interest besides Balto use.
